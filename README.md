Horiseon wants their code to follow correct accessibility standards so it can be viewed on the web.

* When fist viewed source code I noticed that there were divs in locations where there should have been. I changed/ updated them to header, nav, section, article, and footer.

 Viewing the structure of the HTML elements they look pretty well and follow a stuctured order 

* After viewing images i noticed that there were no alt attributes so I added those

I verifed that the heading attributes follows a correct order and just had to move the link under title

* Changed website too "Horiseon website"
