Updated Code base that follows accecability standards

Identified errors in source code
when fist viewed source code I noticed that there were divs in locations where there should have been. I changed/ updated them to header, nav, section, article, and footer.

Viewing the structure of the HTML elements they look pretty well and follow a stuctured order

After viewing images i noticed that there were no alt attributes so I added those

I verifed that the headin attributes follows a correct order and just had to move the link under title
